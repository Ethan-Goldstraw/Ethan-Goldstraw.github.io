        <p> FitCheck is a web application that aims to help users manage their wardrobe virtually and receive 
            personalized outfit recommendations. FitCheck offers fashion advice based on clothing items uploaded by the user, 
            current weather conditions, and trends. FitCheck strives to promote sustainable techniques by maximizing a user's 
            current wardrobe with a selection of outfits, reducing the need to continuously buy new clothes. Also, it provides 
            eco-friendly cleaning strategies to fully maximize the lifespan of the clothing. The idea of this project came from
             the discussion of the environmental impacts that the fashion industry has had globally. Although our clothing is
              something that we are familiar with and think about every day, it was alarming to see how many people were either 
              ignorant of or indifferent about the environmental impacts that fast fashion had. We wanted FitCheck to be a way 
              to show people how to dress their best while also reminding them to be mindful of the consumer-centred culture of fashion. 
              Overall, our application is designed to increase the confidence of its usersâ€™ fashion decisions while raising awareness of sustainable choices. </p>
