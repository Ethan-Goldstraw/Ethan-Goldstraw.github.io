Project Title: About Me Website

Description:
Developing a simple website deployed by Github Pages. The website will consist of information
about me, hyperlinks to internal and external pages. Using Languages CSS and HTML.

I used MIT License because it was one of the more standard ones. Reading it, it seems accurate to what I'm doing. There should
not be charge to anyone with access.
